# ME35_21
This has the LabVIEW (and example) code for Robotics class in 2021.
To use this you will need to install Python3 on your machine and a few libraries (#1 for SPIKE Prime and #2,3 for rPi)
  1. pip3 install pyserial
  2. pip3 install paramiko
  3. pip3 install numpy
  4. pip3 install pillow
  5. pipe install opencv-python
  
There are a few useful things in this code:
  1. LabVIEW code that can save and read files on SPIKE Prime
  2. A REPL for SPIKE Prime to test out code (or save it)
  3. example code on SPIKE
  4. Milan's protocol for the WIO Terminal
  4. Auto
